# Very cool JSON document database

_Mainly a Project for testing and learning._

The goal is to build a very simple and specified JSON document database, storage efficient and data-secure.
It will support operations like query, alter, delete among other manipulative tasks. It will however will **not** support things like authentication, (TODO: add things here). Only data storage and manipulation.

It is either embedded in another program or is used as an active running process that supports communication over some protocol.

The query language will be something different that SQL and consorts (lets try something new), it should however resemble common programming languages.
